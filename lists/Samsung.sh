	# protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an IP network.
	#
	# Directory service refers to the collection of software, hardware, and processes that store and organize everyday items and network resources
	# (folders, files, printers, users, groups, devices, telephone numbers...)
	# It looks like a database but it's different.
	# The thing that Directory service excels at is fast lookups for rarely changing data (email, username etc...)
	# Differences between database and Directory Service : https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/directory-services-vs-rdbms/
	#
	# LDAP uses a relatively simple, string-based query to extract information from Active Directory. LDAP can store and extract objects such as usernames
	# and passwords in Active Directory, and share that object data throughout a network.
	# Example of LDAP usage : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/239385/what-is-ldap-used-for/592339
